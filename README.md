### Wow, a visitor!
Welcome to the 'dumping ground'! 

This repository contains various files, scripts and templates I have found useful. It is, by no means, meant to be used as a self-contained, deploy-able project. 

There might be some gems in here that could help you with your own projects. Feel free to use/share/contribute.

There are sub-folders for software such as Ansible, Terraform and Docker etc., as well as various shell scripts (ksh/bash). There are also lots of unsorted notes for other software. Some of these might be appear to be complete nonsense to anyone but me.
